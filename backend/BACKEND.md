## Modules

---

### Auth (`/api/user/auth`)

Handles Hack Club Auth (HCA) OAuth login, session management, and onboarding.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/login` | Public | Returns HCA OAuth URL (accepts optional `referralCode`, `email`) |
| GET | `/callback` | Public | OAuth callback — exchanges code, creates/updates user, sets session cookie |
| GET | `/me` | User | Returns current user with projects and submissions |
| POST | `/verify-session` | User | Validates session is still active |
| POST | `/logout` | User | Clears session and cookies |
| POST | `/complete-onboarding` | User | Marks onboarding as complete, syncs to Airtable |
| GET | `/onboarding-status` | User | Checks if user still needs to complete profile |
| GET | `/raffle-pos` | User | Returns user's raffle position number |
| POST | `/sync` | User | Forces re-login to sync HCA profile data |

**Key implementation details:**
- State tokens are HMAC-signed with 10-minute TTL
- Sessions expire after 21 days
- `findOrCreateUser()` checks for duplicate HCA accounts, links Hackatime, assigns raffle position, and syncs to Airtable
- Cookie flags: `httpOnly`, `secure` (production), `sameSite: strict/lax`

**Guards & Decorators:**
- `AuthGuard` (global) — validates session cookie, injects `req.user`
- `RolesGuard` — checks `user.role` against `@Roles()` decorator
- `@Public()` — bypasses auth
- `@Roles(Role.Admin)` — restricts to specific roles

---

### User (`/api/user`)

User profile service. The RSVP/sticker system is currently disabled (all methods throw "not enabled").

**Methods (service only, no active endpoints):**
- `createInitialRsvp()` — disabled
- `completeRsvp()` — disabled
- `getRsvpCount()` — returns `{ count: 0 }`
- `verifyStickerToken()` — marks StickerToken as used

---

### Projects (`/api/projects`)

User-facing project creation, editing, submission, and Hackatime linking.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/auth` | User | Create new project |
| GET | `/auth` | User | List current user's projects |
| GET | `/auth/:id` | User | Get project with submissions |
| PUT | `/auth/:id` | User | Update project fields |
| DELETE | `/auth/:id` | User | Delete project (only if no submissions) |
| POST | `/auth/submissions` | User | Submit project for review |
| GET | `/auth/:id/submissions` | User | Get project's submissions |
| PUT | `/auth/:id/hackatime-projects` | User | Link Hackatime projects |
| GET | `/auth/:id/hackatime-projects` | User | Get linked projects with hours |

**Submission validation rules:**
- User must be under 19 years old
- User address must be complete
- Hackatime account must be linked
- All required project fields must be filled (title, description, repo URL, playable URL, screenshot)
- Global submissions freeze must be off

**Key logic:**
- `createProject()` uses a Redis lock to prevent race conditions
- First project creation auto-completes onboarding and syncs to Airtable
- `createSubmission()` recalculates hours from Hackatime API before submitting
- `updateHackatimeProjects()` validates projects aren't linked to other users
- Hackatime hours are calculated from a configurable cutoff date

---

### Reviewer (`/api/reviewer`)

Submission review queue and actions. Accessible to `reviewer` and `admin` roles.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |
|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/queue` | Reviewer | List pending submissions (PII-scoped) |
| GET | `/submissions/:id` | Reviewer | Full submission detail with timeline |
| PUT | `/submissions/:id/review` | Reviewer | Review submission (approve/reject with hours and feedback) |
| POST | `/submissions/:id/quick-approve` | Reviewer | Auto-approve using Hackatime hours |
| GET | `/projects/:id/notes` | Reviewer | Get shared reviewer note on project |
| PUT | `/projects/:id/notes` | Reviewer | Save reviewer note on project |
| GET | `/users/:id/notes` | Reviewer | Get shared reviewer note on user |
| PUT | `/users/:id/notes` | Reviewer | Save reviewer note on user |
| GET | `/submissions/:id/checklist` | Reviewer | Get 7-item review checklist state |
| PUT | `/submissions/:id/checklist` | Reviewer | Save checklist state |

**PII scoping:** Reviewer endpoints never expose email, address, or birthday. Only `userId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `slackUserId`, and computed `age` are returned via `scopeUserData()`.

**Review flow:**
1. Reviewer pulls queue → gets pending submissions with project/user overview
2. Selects submission → gets full detail with timeline of all submissions and reviews
3. Reviews: sets `approvalStatus`, `approvedHours`, `userFeedback`, `hoursJustification`
4. Creates audit log entry
5. On first approval: syncs to Airtable with delta hours (subtracts previously approved hours)
6. Sends Slack DM always on status change; email is conditional

**Quick approve:** Auto-fills `approvedHours` from Hackatime hours, sets status to `approved`, sends Slack notification only (no email).

---

### Admin (`/api/admin`)

| **Settings** |||
| GET | `/settings` | Admin | Global settings (submissions freeze flag) |
| PUT | `/settings/submissions-frozen` | Admin | Toggle global submissions freeze |

**Key operations:**
- `recalculateProjectHours()` re-fetches hours from Hackatime API for individual or all projects
- `getProjectTimeline()` builds a comprehensive timeline with creation, submissions, reviews, and audit log entries
- `getPriorityUsers()` uses raw SQL to find users who need 50+ hours and would reach it with pending approvals

### Hackatime (`/api/hackatime`)

Hackatime OAuth integration and hours tracking.

**Endpoints:**

| Method | Route | Auth | Description |

- `handleCallback()` checks for duplicate Hackatime accounts across users
- Hours are fetched since a configurable cutoff date (currently 2026-02-21)
- `recalculateNowHackatimeHours()` updates all projects in parallel
- `calculateHackatimeHours()` sums durations and rounds to 0.1 hours

---

### GitHub (`/api/github`)

GitHub repository information and README fetching. Accessible to `reviewer` and `admin` roles.

**Endpoints:**

|--------|-------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/repo?url=<github-url>` | Reviewer | Fetch repo stats, commits with diff stats |
| GET | `/readme?url=<github-url>` | Reviewer | Get raw README markdown content |

**Key implementation details:**
- **Token pooling:** Distributes API calls across multiple GitHub tokens (configured via `GITHUB_TOKENS` env var, comma-separated). Tracks per-token usage to stay under 5000 req/hr per token.
- **Commit fetching:** Retrieves all commits in batches of 15, includes additions/deletions stats per commit.
- **README resolution:** Tries `raw.githubusercontent.com` across common branches (`main`, `master`) and filenames (`README.md`, `readme.md`, `README`).
- Falls back to unauthenticated requests (60 req/hr) if no tokens configured.

## Key Business Flows

### Project Submission
1. User creates project → Redis lock prevents duplicates → auto-completes onboarding
2. User links Hackatime projects → validates not linked to other users
3. User fills all fields (title, description, repo, playable URL, screenshot)
4. User submits → validates age < 19, address complete, Hackatime linked, submissions not frozen
5. Hours recalculated from Hackatime API at submission time

### Submission Review
1. Reviewer fetches queue → pending submissions with PII-scoped user data
2. Reviewer opens submission → full detail with timeline
3. Reviewer sets status, hours, feedback → audit log created
4. First approval → Airtable record created with delta hours
5. Subsequent edits → Airtable record updated
6. Slack DM sent always; email sent conditionally

### Shop Purchase
1. User checks balance (approved hours - spent)
2. User purchases → validates `verified_eligible` via external API, checks stock and per-user limits
3. Transaction created, balance deducted
4. Item #1 (Midnight ticket) → registers in attend.hackclub.com
5. Admin fulfills → email sent to user
